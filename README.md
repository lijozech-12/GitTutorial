# GitTutorial
A repo for Paractice Version control in Git &amp; Github

## Git Clone

1. Open a folder in Visual Studio code.
2. Open the terminal.
3. Write the Command **_git clone link that got from git clone_**

   

## Changeing the file

1. With the help of Visual Studio Code make changes in the folder like adding a new file or changes in existing file.

## git status

This command is used to check the Status of different file in the repo.
Status like modified, Untracked, newfile etc....
After changeing file use **_git status_** command.

## Untracked files
 
Untracked files are the new files.That means git doesn't know about this file. So we need to tell git. **A new file is here buddy :)**

1. Use **_git add filename/foldername_** To track specific file/folder.
    
    To practice this I added a **index.html** file and Test folder to this repo

2. You can also use **_git add ._** To track all the files &amp; folders.
